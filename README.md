## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project is a CNN-based system designed to classify **7 facial expressions** â€” Happy, Sad, Angry, Disgust, Fear, Surprise, and Neutral â€” from static or webcam images.

Developed as part of a summer training program at **Future University in Egypt**, in collaboration with **AMIT Learning**, and mentored by **Mohamed Gomaa**, the project explores practical applications in **healthcare, security, customer service**, and **HCI (Human-Computer Interaction)**.
