## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on the **EfficientNetB2** architecture to recognize **seven distinct facial expressions** (Happy, Sad, Angry, Disgust, Fear, Surprise, Neutral) from images. The system was built as part of a collaborative summer training program between **Future University in Egypt** and **AMIT Learning**.

It performs real-time emotion recognition via webcam, making it applicable in fields such as **healthcare, customer service, security**, and **human-computer interaction**.
